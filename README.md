# esx_tattooshop
Edited and unbugged esx_tattooshop. Division on body parts!

# Description
- In this version you get division on body parts (neck, back etc.)

- If you don't have got money you can't buy tattoo and it won't save

- Deleted cam - you can use mouse to rotate screen

- When you'll click backspace tattoo won't save

- Possibility to remove all tattoos

If you have got other version you have to clear tattoos for all players - I'm using my own UPDATE queries!

# Installation
Drag and drop. You also need to have es_extended installed. Don't forget about .sql file!
